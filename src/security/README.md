My satellites communicate by encrypting & authenticating messages before sending them across space. Here’s how I utilize XChaCha20-Poly1305:

1️⃣ A satellite wants to send a secure message.
2️⃣ Encrypt the message with XChaCha20:

Uses a random 24-byte nonce.
Uses a shared 32-byte encryption key.
Encrypts the data and generates a Poly1305 authentication tag. 3️⃣ The receiver verifies the Poly1305 tag:
If the authentication tag is valid, decrypt the message.
If it’s tampered with, reject it (prevents spoofing or MITM attacks).

Example:
Satellite A encrypts a telemetry packet and sends it to Satellite B.
Satellite B verifies the authenticity & decrypts it.

Why is ChaCha20 a Great Stream Cipher?
ChaCha20 is a modern, secure, and efficient stream cipher. It improves upon older ciphers like RC4 by being:
1. Faster than AES on software-only implementations (no need for AES-NI hardware).
2. Resistant to side-channel attacks (unlike AES, which can be vulnerable to cache timing attacks).
3. No block constraints → Can encrypt any amount of data without padding.
4. Secure against nonce reuse issues (when used with XChaCha20).

Why I Use It in My Satellite Project:
Satellites communicate in a continuous stream (telemetry, commands, messages).
SO Low-latency and fast encryption/decryption is required.
Works efficiently on embedded systems and Rust implementations.
Authenticated Encryption (AEAD) prevents tampering with messages.

Example (Simplified XOR-based Stream Cipher):
Plaintext:  H   E   L   L   O
Binary:    0100 1000 0100 0101 0100 1100 0100 1100 0100 1111
Keystream: 1100 0110 1010 0111 1001 0011 1101 1101 0110 1001
Ciphertext:1000 1110 1110 0010 1101 1111 1001 0001 0010 0110
Encryption: Ciphertext = Plaintext ⊕ Keystream
Decryption: Plaintext = Ciphertext ⊕ Keystream

**MAC Generation:**

1. **Inputs**:
    - **Message**: The data you want to authenticate.
    - **Secret key**: A shared secret key used in the HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) process.
2. **Process**:
    - The message and the secret key are input into the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm.
3. **Output**:
    - **Hash**: The output is a hash value, also known as the MAC. This hash ensures the integrity and authenticity of the message.

**MAC Verification:**

1. **Inputs**:
    - **Message**: The original data you want to verify.
    - **Secret key**: The same shared secret key used in the MAC generation.
    - **Hash**: The hash value (MAC) that was generated during the MAC generation process.
2. **Process**:
    - The message and the secret key are input into the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm to generate a new hash.
    - The new hash is compared with the original hash.
3. **Output**:
    - If the newly generated hash matches the original hash, the verification is successful (indicated by the green check mark). 
    This confirms that the message has not been altered and is authentic.
